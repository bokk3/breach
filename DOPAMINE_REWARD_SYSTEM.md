# Dopamine-Driven Reward System Design

## Core Psychological Principles

### 1. Variable Reward Schedule
- Unpredictable rewards create stronger dopamine responses
- Mix guaranteed and random rewards
- Create "near-miss" moments that keep players engaged

### 2. Immediate Feedback
- Instant visual and audio confirmation
- Numbers go up = brain happy
- Cascading effects and chain reactions

### 3. Achievement Milestones
- Short-term goals (combo streaks)
- Medium-term goals (level ups)
- Long-term goals (achievements/badges)

### 4. Loss Aversion
- Fear of losing combo creates tension
- Risk/reward decisions
- "One more try" psychology
